                <p>
                    Hi, I'm a second-year Information Technology student at Salem State University, minoring in Cyber Security.
                    I've always had a facination with technology, over time I've specifically developed an interest in networking, which is currently my passion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This website serves both as a personal space and a portfilio to showcase what I've worked on.
                    I'm always looking to learn more, take on new challenges, and connect with like-minded people.
                    Feel free to explore this website, my work, or reach out and get in touch!
                </p>

                <h2>About this site:</h2>
                <p>
                    This site is inspired by the early internet — specifically the weird, terribly designed and minimalist pags from the 2000s and early 2010s.
                    Bright colors, bad layouts, and terrible navigation were all part of the aestetic.
                    It’s a look that feels nostalgic and unique to me; with this website I wanted to bring some of that energy back.
                </p>

                <small><i>(Although, this website I would say is designed quite nicely, haha)</i></small>
